- **Data Cleaning and Refinement (Upcoming):** Upcoming updates will include data cleaning and refinement processes to ensure accurate and high-quality scraped data.

- **User-Friendly Interface (Upcoming):** Future versions may introduce a user-friendly graphical interface for easier configuration and monitoring of the scraping process.
